What a phenomenal talent! Lennart Karl is already rewriting Bayern's history books at just 17—two UCL goals in two starts? The future of German football is blindingly bright. Can't wait to see him light up the Allianz Arena for years to come! 🇩🇪✨
Lennart Karl just reminded Arsenal how fragile their so called ‘defense’ is….Pure comedy
This kid is seventeen and already cooking Premier League defenses like it is nothing. Arsenal fans spent all summer bragging about their clean sheets and one German teenager just ended that story in ninety seconds. Bayern keeps finding these monsters in their academy while half the big clubs waste hundreds of millions on finished players. The gap between youth development in Germany and England looks massive right now.
"Kid is moving like he didn’t get the memo about pressure. Two UCL starts, two goals, and he’s already rewriting Bayern’s record book. What a rise.💯🐐"
"If na that lousy guy now, we no go rest"
"Lennart Karl's record-breaking start is not a testament to his unique genius, but a worrying symptom of the diluted and predictable nature of the Champions League group stage under its new format."
Better than that Barcelona fraud
"The kid is a gem, watched him at the weekend, a class act"
Where's Kane I think he's a goal machine that always score in a single match
