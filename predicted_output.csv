What a phenomenal talent! Lennart Karl is already rewriting Bayern's history books at just 17—two UCL goals in two starts? The future of German football is blindingly bright. Can't wait to see him light up the Allianz Arena for years to come! 🇩🇪✨,Human,0.6579719685585943
Lennart Karl just reminded Arsenal how fragile their so called ‘defense’ is….Pure comedy,Human,0.5759163501698251

Bayern keeps finding these monsters in their academy while half the big clubs waste hundreds of millions on finished players. The gap between youth development in Germany and England looks massive right now.,Human,0.5267599525401832
